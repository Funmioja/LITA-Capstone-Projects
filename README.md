### Sales Data Analysis Report on Capstone project
## Overview
This report provides an initial exploration of a sales dataset to identify key insights and trends. 
I performed a basic analysis using pivot tables and Excel formulas to calculate metrics, 
such as total sales by product, region, and month, along with average sales per product and total revenue by region. 
Additional analyses were conducted to uncover interesting patterns in the data, which can help inform business decisions.
